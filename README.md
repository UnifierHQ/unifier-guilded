Unifier Guilded Support extension for Unifier bot

> [!NOTE]
> This is a Unifier **plugin**! To access Unifier, go [here](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/unifier).

## What is this?
This is a plugin for Unifier which allows it to work on Guilded, a Discord alternative. This plugin manages the 
Guilded instance and allows messages from Guilded to be bridged to other platforms.

It is like [Unifier Revolt Support](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/unifier-revolt), except it is for Guilded.

## Requirements
Unifier v2.0.0 or newer is required.

## Setup
To install Unifier Guilded Support, you can run `u!system install https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-guilded` on the bot.
This will install the plugin through System Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> You may see an unknown service error if you use Unifier v2. This is because these versions do not support services
> providing Native Universal Platform Support (NUPS). Guilded Support should still work without NUPS on these versions.
