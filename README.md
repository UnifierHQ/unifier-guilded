## What is this?
This is a plugin for Unifier which allows it to work on Guilded, a Discord alternative. This plugin manages the 
Guilded  instance and allows messages from Guilded to be bridged to other platforms.

It is like [Unifier Revolt Support](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/unifier-revolt), except it is for Guilded.

## Requirements
Unifier v1.1.8 or newer is required.

## Setup
To install Unifier Revolt Support, you can run `u!install-guilded` on the bot. If you have a different GitHub user URL 
set for `files_endpoint`, the user will need to fork this repository for the command to work.
